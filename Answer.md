## Q3 What is Programming Language
A programming language is a formal language with a set of rules and syntax used to write computer programs or software applications. It provides a means for programmers to communicate instructions to a computer or other programmable device.

Programming languages are designed to be readable and understandable by both humans and machines. They allow programmers to express algorithms, logic, and computations in a structured and systematic manner. Each programming language has its own syntax, keywords, rules, and conventions that define how programs should be written.

There are numerous programming languages available, each with its own strengths and purposes. Some popular programming languages include:
Python: A versatile and beginner-friendly language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.

Java: A general-purpose language that emphasizes portability and cross-platform compatibility. It is commonly used for building enterprise-level applications, Android apps, and large-scale systems.

C++: A powerful and efficient language often used for system programming, game development, and resource-intensive applications.

JavaScript: A scripting language primarily used for web development. It enables interactivity and dynamic content on websites and is widely supported by web browsers.

Ruby: A user-friendly language known for its elegant syntax and focus on simplicity. It is popular for web development with the Ruby on Rails framework.

C#: A language developed by Microsoft that is widely used for Windows application development, game development, and enterprise software.
